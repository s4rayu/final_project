##Hi! This program models Stellar Evolution and Element Isotope Production from Mass (M) and Metallicity (Z) 
To run the program, simply open ***main.ipynb*** and click run. Input your desired values for these two parameters when prompted and you will see the predicted final *stellar remnant, effective mass, main sequence lifetime, and element isotope yield*, along with some visualizations!
